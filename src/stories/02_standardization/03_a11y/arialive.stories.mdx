# Aria Live Notifications

**Via [MDN web docs:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions)**
> “Using JavaScript, it is possible to dynamically change parts of a page without requiring the entire page to reload — for instance, to update a list of search results on the fly, or to display a discreet alert or notification which does not require user interaction. While these changes are usually visually apparent to users who can see the page, they may not be obvious to users of assistive technologies. ARIA live regions fill this gap and provide a way to programmatically expose dynamic content changes in a way that can be announced by assistive technologies."

There are many places in Highpoint apps where markup programmatically changes. In order to make these apps accessible, aria-live notifications need to be used to indicate these changes.

### Use Cases: 

* Content has dynamically changed on the page (e.g. list of items is changed after search)
* Page route is updated without reload (e.g. ReactRouter)
* Validation state changes

## React-Aria-Live

Highpoint apps use the react-aria-live package to handle sending aria-live messages to the user’s screen reader.

There are three important components in this package: 


1. **LiveAnnouncer** is the component that renders the aria-live region and handles broadcasting messages. This component needs to be wrapped around the entire app. This should be close to, if not, the outermost component in the app.

`<LiveAnnouncer><App /></LiveAnnouncer>`

There are two components that can be used to send aria-live messages:

2. **LiveMessenger** is a render-prop component that can be used to retrieve the announcePolite and announceAssertive functions which can be used to send live notifications. See the react-aria-live docs for a full component description.

3. **LiveMessage** is a component that sends an aria-live notification as soon as it is mounted. See the react-aria-live docs for a full component description.

These two components can be used interchangeably, so whichever one works best for the given situation can be used.

### Example (Updated route):

<Source code={`
<LiveMessenger>
{
 ({announcePolite, announceAssertive}) => 
   <Button 
     text='Navigate' 
     onClick={() => {
       announcePolite("Navigated to <page name>");
       window.location.href = <new url>;
     }} />
}
</LiveMessenger>`} />

### Example (List refreshed):

<Source code={`
{
 hasLoaded && (
   <>
     <-- markup loaded -->
     <LiveMessage 
       aria-live="polite" 
       message="List updated" 
       clearOnUnmount={true} />
   </>
 )
}`} />

### Example (Validation):

<Source code={`
<>
 <Button disabled={isFormValid} text="Submit" onClick={submitForm} />
  { isFormValid ?
    <LiveMessage aria-live="polite" message="Form is valid" /> :
    <LiveMessage aria-live="polite" message="Form is invalid" />
  }
</>`} />
